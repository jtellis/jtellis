# Greetings!

## A bit about myself

I'm at home in fast paced multidisciplinary teams striving to make an impact. I have worked with academic institutions, non-profit organizations, start-up and long established companies. I approach my work with a spirit of challenge and determination.

## Projects

* ‚è±Ô∏è I had some fun creating a [workout circuit timer application](https://github.com/jtellis/workout-app#workout-circuit-timer). I used [statecharts](https://stately.ai/docs/state-machines-and-statecharts) to manage state. It was a great *exercise* in React state management and UI creation.

* üñºÔ∏è I also dove into the foundementals of server-side rendering and static-site generation with React over in [ssr react adventure](https://github.com/jtellis/ssr-react-adventure).

* üèÜ In the Fall of 2020, I was a co-developer of [NYS COVID-19 Parent Portal](https://elated-yalow-5a2413.netlify.app/) which was completed during the Hack Upstate XV hackathon event. This project won the event's prize for "Best Use of Open Data." The full project submission can be seen [here on DEVPOST](https://devpost.com/software/nys-covid-19-parent-portal) and my code contributions are [here on github](https://github.com/jtellis/hu-covid-resource-site#nys-covid-19-parent-portal).

* üÉè A while ago, I wrote a version of the card game [blackjack (21)](https://github.com/jtellis/blackjack#blackjack-21) in Haskell to practice functional programming. My hope was to reinforce what I had studied in the *Learn You a Haskell* book.

* üìñ I'm interested in the Rust type system through my study of Haskell. My overall goal is to target WebAssembly compiliation. I'm working through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and keeping my progress in [this repo](https://github.com/jtellis/rust-book-exercises). I hope to get back to this soon.

When I'm not coding away, I'm usually bird watching, learning about and spending time in nature, exercising, baking or watching an old movie. I have two dogs that remind me to never take it all too seriously.

Drop me a line. Cheers! ‚òï
